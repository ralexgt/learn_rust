# Preface
-> Backend application cloud-native styled
-> Emphasis on good practices for: cloud native, working in a team, test driven development, CI from the start, black box testing for APIs and HTTP mocking
-> The focus is enterprise software: correct code which is expressive enough to model the domain and provide enough support for its evolution over time

# Getting started
-> Tooling
	-> Rust toolchain `rustup`: rustc, cargo
	-> Rust-analyzer or IntelliJ Rust for IDE code navigation
	-> cargo-watch
	-> cargo-tarpaulin
	-> clippy
	-> rustfmt
	-> cargo-audit
	-> log crate is the go to for logging in rust

-> **Inner Development Loop**:
	1. Make changes
	2. Compile the application
	3. Run tests
	4. Run the application
-> To improve compilation time:
	-> Use faster linker: LLD
	-> cargo-watch: cargo watch -x check -x test -x run

# Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline
1. Tests
-> `cargo test`
2. Code coverage
-> `cargo-tarpaulin` will give you some code coverage insights
3. Linting
-> Static analysis a *linter* does to try and spot unidiomatic code, overly-complex constructs and common mistakes/inefficiencies
-> `rustup component add clippy` and `cargo clippy` to run Rust's linter
4. Formatting
-> `rustfmt` for formatting
5. Security vulnerabilities
-> `cargo install cargo-audit` and `cargo audit`
