-> We expect to have an embedded form on a webpage 
-> The submission of the form will trigger an API call to the newsletter backend server
-> The server will actually process the information, store it and send back a response

-> This part will cover the backend server with a `/subscriptions` POST endpoint

-> Initial heavylifting: web framework, testing, crate to interact with the database, migrations, queries

-> To become a little bit familiar with the web framework, first will write a `health_check` endpoint. No business logic, but good to get to know your tool

-> The CI pipeline should give us a certain amount of assurance, so we do not have to be too scared of shipping what would not be ready

-> `Actix extractors`
	-> `Path` - get dynamic path segments from a request's path
	-> `Qury` for query parameters
	-> `Json` to parse a JSON-encoded request body
	-> Many more


# Database
-> Postgres via docker container
-> Check `scripts/init_db.sh`
-> Will be using `sqlx` to manage the sql queries and database migrations
-> `sqlx-cli` is a cargo binary that is a cli tool
