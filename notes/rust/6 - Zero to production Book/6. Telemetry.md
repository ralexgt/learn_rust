-> After implementing the subscribing feature we tested in a black box environment through integration tests.
-> It might be temping to just deploy the functionality and have it working. However we are blind to anything that happens if we do that. 

# Known unknowns
-> What would happen if someone tries to pass malicious payloads in the body of our POST /subscriptions request? What happens if we lose connection to the database?

# Unknown unknowns
-> Issues that we have not seen beforeand we are not even expecting
-> Usually impossible to reproduce outside of the live environment

# Logs
-> `actix-web` provides a Logger middleware emitting a log record for every incoming request
-> In actix specifically, you can `wrap()` a middleware around the `App`
-> `log` is just a facade for logging. We will use `env-logger` to complement as our logging  "engine"

# From log to `tracing`
-> We can leverage `Span` to have tracing that spans the entire function
