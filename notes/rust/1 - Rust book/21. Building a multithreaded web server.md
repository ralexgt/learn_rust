# Single-threaded web server
-> Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
-> Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
-> They are both request-response protocols
-> A client initiates requests and a server listens and provides a response
-> The contents of the requests and responses are defined by the protocols
-> TCP is the lower-level protocol that describes how information gets from one server to another, but doesn't specify what that information is
-> HTTP builds on top of TCP by defining the contents of the requests and responses

-> The server needs to listen to a TCP connection
-> The standard library offers a `std::net` module for that
-> In networking, connecting to a port to listen is known as *binding to a port*, hence in the standard library `std::net::TcpListener::bind()` is used as a `new()` function

-> With a single thread server, it will process each request in turn. Meaning the second request will have to wait until the first request finished

# Improving throughput with a thread pool
-> A thread pool is a group of spawned threads that are ready and waiting to handle a task
-> You usually do not want to create  a thread for each request, one reason would be beacuse it makes you very susceptible to DoS attacks
-> So you will have a pool of N threads that will take requests from a queue of tasks
-> There are other ways to do this
