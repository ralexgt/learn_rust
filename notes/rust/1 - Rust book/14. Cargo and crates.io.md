-> cargo build, run, test
# Customizing builds with release profiles
-> Release profiles are predefined, customizable with different configurations to allow a programmer to have more control over various options for compiling code
-> Each profile is configured independently of the others

-> Cargo has 2 main profiles:
	-> dev - `cargo build`
	-> release - `cargo build --release`
-> There are predefined configurations that you can override if you add your config with `[profile.*]` in `Cargo.toml`. Ex. `[profile.dev] opt-level = 0 [profile.release] opt-level = 3`
-> `opt-level` controls the number of optimizations Rust will apply to your code, with a range of 0 to 3
# Publishing a crate to `Crates.io`
-> Used to add packages as dependencies
-> Used to publish code, sharing own packages with others
-> The crate registry at `crates.io` distributes the source code of the package, so it primarily hosts code that is open source

-> `///` are the documentation comments
-> They are placed right before the item they are documenting
-> Support Markdown notation for formatting the text
-> Will generate HTML documentations from them for public API items
-> Documentation is intended for programmers interested in knowing ***how to use*** your crate as opposed to ***how your crate is implemented***
-> Adding example code blocks in your documentation comments can help demonstrate how to use the library. Additionally, running `cargo test` will run the code examples in your documentation as tests. With this we can always be sure that the code in the documentation is always up to date and running properly

-> `//!` adds the documentation to the item it is inside of

# Workspaces
-> Help you manage multiple related packages developed in tandem
-> A *workspace* is a set of packages that share the same Cargo.lock and output directory
-> In `Cargo.toml` you can have `[workspace]` with `resolver = "3"`, which is the algorithm to resolve your workspace
-> Running cargo new in a workspace automatically updates the root `Cargo.toml`
-> `cargo build` will build the entire workspace
-> Building will create a single `target directory`, at the root of the workspace. Also a single `Cargo.lock`
-> `cargo run -p crate_name` specifies which crate we wish to run
-> Even if every crate is in the same workspace, Rust doesnt assume dependencies. You still need to define each dependency in the specific `Cargo.toml`
# Installing binaries with `cargo install`
-> Used to install crates that have a binary
-> Will be stored in the instaltion root's directory bin, usually `$HOME/.cargo/bin`
