# Overview
-> let and match
-> methods and associated functions
-> external crates

# Standard library docs
-> prelude is used implicitly
-> Other crates have prelude too, but you have to import it with `use crate::prelude`
-> Docs are pretty nice at least for standard library

# Associated function
-> Associated to a type, use type::function to all it

# Crates
-> library crates vs. binary crates
