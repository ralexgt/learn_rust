-> useful data structures called collections
-> Most other types represent one specific value, but collection can contain multiple values
-> Unlike arrays and tuples, these collections are stored on the heap. Meaning that the compiler doesn't need to know the exact size and it can be decided at runtime, also grow or shrink as the program runs
-> There are different types of collections, each having trade offs and their specific scenarios for usage
-> Some of these common collections are:
	-> Vectors, that allow you to store a variable number of values next to each other
	-> Strings, a collection of characters
	-> Hash maps, allowing you to associate a value wih a specific key
# Vectors
-> `Vec<T>`
-> Vectors allow you to put more values in a single data structure, all being stored in memory next to each other
-> `Vec::new()` initialize a new empty vector
-> `vec![values]` is a macro to initialize a vector with the values in `[]`

-> You can use eiter 0-indexing with `[]` or `v.get(index)` to read the value in the vector
	-> `[]` returns the element, `v.get()` returns Option<&T>
	-> You should take references, not the actual value. Like this it doesn't get moved

-> `*` is used to dereference and get the value specified by the reference

-> Vectors can hold only values of the same type. But we can still hold multiple types using an enum. Having the vector being `Vec<ENUM>` means we can hold any of its variants

# Strings
-> UTF-8 encoded text
-> `str` => string slice, present in the core language
-> String literals are stored in the program's binary and are `str`

-> String is built on top of a Vector of bytes, with extra guarantees, restrictions and capabilities, so it has some of the same funcitonalities, like `new`
-> `.to_string` available to any type implementing display
-> `String::from()` does the same thing
-> `push_str` for pushing `&str`,  `push` for pushing `char`, `+` for concatenating 2 `Strings`, `format!` for formatting a String to your liking and returning it to a value
-> `+` requieres the first argument to be an owned string, so it will be `moved`

# Hashmaps
-> `HashMap<K, V>`
-> `HashMap::new()` to create and `h.insert()` to add elements to it
-> `.entry()` returns an Entry enum with `<K, V>`
